# HW1
this is homework 1 for EC601A2
the programming language used is Processing.
Processing is a fully-functional programming language based on Java where the introduction is less like writing “Hello World” program, and more like “Draw a smiley face” for saying hello.
As artists and designers have started using software as a primary part of their process, Processing allows them to go deeper and start to think about software not as mimicking these prior tools or processes such as a dark room or a drafting table. Writing code is a way of thinking about making something new and unique, and getting around some of the constraints of point-and-click software tools.

there are two ways to run the reflection code
1: download and install Processing from processing.org
   open the .pde file with Processing
   run the .pde file as sketches
   or
   choose java mode in Processing
   export the .pde sketch as Java Application (for Mac, Windows and Linux systems)
   run the application
   
2: download the .java file and run with any java IDE

1st step is followed for Transparency.pde
